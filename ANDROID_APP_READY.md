## 🔧 If Gradle Issues Persist

You already have Gradle downloaded. To manually extract:

```bash
# Navigate to Gradle directory
cd %USERPROFILE%\.gradle\wrapper\dists\gradle-8.11.1-all\2qik7nd48slq1ooc2496ixf4i

# Extract using PowerShell
powershell -Command "Expand-Archive -Path gradle-8.11.1-all.zip -DestinationPath . -Force"

# Or use 7-Zip/WinRAR to extract gradle-8.11.1-all.zip to the same folder
```

After extraction, you should see a `gradle-8.11.1` folder with these contents:
- bin/
- lib/
- init.d/
- LICENSE
- NOTICE
- README
