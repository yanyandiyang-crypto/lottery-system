# ✅ pgAdmin4 Connected! Just Need to Fix Settings

## 🎉 **Good News:** Your connection WORKS!

Your logs show:
```
✅ connection authorized: user=postgres database=lottery_m6px
✅ SSL enabled (TLSv1.3)
✅ Connected successfully!
❌ But disconnects after 3 seconds
```

**Problem:** Wrong username! You used `postgres` but should use `lottery`

---

## 🔧 **FIX: Update pgAdmin4 Settings**

### In pgAdmin4:

1. **Right-click** your Render server
2. **Click:** "Properties"

### Connection Tab - UPDATE THESE:

```
Username:
lottery
(Change from: postgres → lottery)

Password:
NOfMMQoXGSlSaMZVbpHMJWIPA4f3vmrZ

Host:
dpg-d3j4juc9c44c73b6m6c0-a.oregon-postgres.render.com

Port:
5432

Database:
lottery_m6px

✅ Save password: YES
```

### SSL Tab:

```
SSL mode: Require
(Keep TLSv1.3 - it's working!)
```

### Advanced Tab - Parameters (ADD THESE):

**Click "+" to add each parameter:**

```
Name: connect_timeout
Value: 30

Name: keepalives
Value: 1

Name: keepalives_idle  
Value: 30

Name: keepalives_interval
Value: 10

Name: application_name
Value: pgAdmin4
```

### Click "Save"

---

## ✅ **This Should Fix the Disconnection!**

The keepalives will prevent the connection from timing out.

---

## 🧪 **Test Again:**

1. **Close** existing connection (if any)
2. **Double-click** server name to reconnect
3. **Should see:**
   ```
   ✅ Connected!
   ✅ Stays connected!
   └─ lottery_m6px
      └─ Schemas  
         └─ public
            └─ Tables
   ```

---

## 🚨 **If Still Disconnects:**

### Try These:

#### Option 1: Different SSL Mode
```
SSL tab:
Try: Prefer (instead of Require)
Or: Allow
```

#### Option 2: Longer Timeout
```
Parameters:
connect_timeout: 60
statement_timeout: 60000
```

#### Option 3: Different Connection Method
```
Instead of "Maintenance database":
Try connecting to: postgres (system database)
Then browse to: lottery_m6px database
```

---

## 💡 **Why It's Disconnecting:**

### Common Render + pgAdmin4 Issues:

1. **Wrong Username** ✅ (Your issue - using postgres instead of lottery)
2. **Idle Timeout** (Fixed with keepalives)
3. **SSL Handshake** (Working - using TLSv1.3)
4. **Firewall** (Working - connection established)

---

## ✅ **SUMMARY:**

**Your Issue:**
```
❌ Username: postgres (WRONG)
✅ Should be: lottery
```

**Fix:**
```
pgAdmin4 → Properties → Connection tab
Change username to: lottery
Save and reconnect
```

**Should work now!** 🎉

---

**Update ang username sa pgAdmin4 to `lottery` and try again!** 🔧

**It will work - your connection is already successful, just wrong user!** 💪
