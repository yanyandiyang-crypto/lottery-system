# 🔍 Check Render Deployment Status

## ⏳ Render Should Be Deploying Now!

**What to check:**

### 1. Go to Render Dashboard
```
URL: https://dashboard.render.com
Login: Your Render account
```

### 2. Find Your Service
```
Click: "lottery-backend" (or your backend service name)
```

### 3. Check Deploy Status

You should see one of these:

#### 🟢 **Deploying...** (Good!)
```
Status: "Deploy in progress"
Started: Just now
Branch: main or master

What to do: Wait 2-5 minutes

Progress:
→ Installing dependencies...
→ Running build command...
→ Starting service...
→ Health check...
→ ✅ Live
```

#### 🔴 **No New Deploy?** (Fix needed)

If you DON'T see a new deployment starting:

**Check these settings in Dashboard:**

#### Setting 1: Auto-Deploy
```
1. Click your service "lottery-backend"
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Scroll to "Build & Deploy"
4. Check: "Auto-Deploy" = YES

If NO:
→ Toggle to YES
→ Click "Save Changes"
```

#### Setting 2: Branch
```
Still in Settings → Build & Deploy:

Check: "Branch" = main or master

If wrong:
→ Change to "main" (or whichever you're using)
→ Click "Save Changes"
```

#### Setting 3: GitHub Connection
```
Settings → Build & Deploy → GitHub:

Check: Repository connected?

If not connected:
→ Click "Connect to GitHub"
→ Authorize Render
→ Select repository: lottery-system
→ Select branch: main
```

## 📝 Quick Checklist

Go to Render Dashboard and verify:

- [ ] Service: lottery-backend exists
- [ ] Status: Shows "Deploy in progress" OR "Live"
- [ ] Branch: Set to "main" (or "master" if that's what you use)
- [ ] Auto-Deploy: Enabled (toggle = YES)
- [ ] GitHub: Connected to lottery-system repo

## 💡 Alternative: Manual Deploy Right Now

If you want to deploy immediately without waiting for auto-deploy:

```
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click: lottery-backend
3. Click: "Manual Deploy" (top right)
4. Click: "Deploy latest commit"
5. Wait: 2-5 minutes
6. Done! ✅
```

This bypasses auto-deploy and forces immediate deployment.

# Expected:

# If this works:
✅ Render deployed successfully!
