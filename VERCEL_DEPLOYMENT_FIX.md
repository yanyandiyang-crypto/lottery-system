# Vercel Deployment Fix Summary

## ✅ Issue Resolved

**Error**: `Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'qrcode' in '/vercel/path0/frontend/src/utils'`

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. Missing Dependency
- **Problem**: The `qrcode` package was being imported dynamically in `mobilePOSUtils.js` but wasn't installed
- **Solution**: Added `qrcode` package to dependencies
- **Command**: `npm install qrcode`

### 2. Package.json Updated
- Added `qrcode` dependency to `frontend/package.json`
- Updated `package-lock.json` with new dependency tree

## 📋 Current Dependencies

The frontend now has both QR code packages:
- `qrcode.react`: For React components (already existed)
- `qrcode`: For Node.js/server-side QR generation (newly added)

## 🚀 Deployment Status

- ✅ Dependencies fixed
- ✅ Changes synced to GitHub (commit: `1847e3b`)
- ✅ Ready for Vercel redeployment

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Redeploy on Vercel**: The deployment should now work without the module resolution error
2. **Monitor Build**: Check Vercel build logs to ensure successful deployment
3. **Test QR Functionality**: Verify QR code generation works in production

## 📝 Files Modified

- `frontend/package.json` - Added qrcode dependency
- `frontend/package-lock.json` - Updated dependency tree

## 🎯 Vercel Configuration

The `vercel.json` configuration is properly set up with:
- Build command: `npm install && npm run build`
- Output directory: `build`
- Environment variables configured
- Routes properly mapped

## ✅ Expected Result

The Vercel deployment should now complete successfully without the `qrcode` module resolution error.
